<p>Shazif Shaikh is currently a senior at Stuyvesant High School. At 17 years old, he has been building robots since he was 10. His introduction to robotics came in the form of FIRST Robotics First Tech Challenge. Since then, he has been a part of Stuyvesant's Robotics team, referees FIRST Competitions, and teaches a robotics summer program at York College. Currently, he is coaching a robotics team sponsored by York College and the One Hundred Black Men of America.</p>

<a name="mission-statement" class="anchor" href="#mission-statement"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mission Statement</h3>

<p>Staten Island is a borough of New York City that has been dubbed the "Forgotten Borough". Currently, Staten Island's transportation system is composed of one functioning railroad, buses, and ferries. The lack of quick public transportation due to engineering and logistical issues forces us to earn that nickname. There are hundreds of students on Staten Island who are without the access to local STEM programs such as robotics. The only high school that has a reputable robotics program on Staten Island doubles as the only specialized high school on Staten Island; Staten Island Technical High School. If STEM programs were open to more students, it would be an investment into the future of Staten Island. The resulting students who go on to pursue careers in engineering, programming, and marketing would be able to connect Staten Island to other boroughs in ways that are currently unavailable. Allow us to expand Staten Island by investing in the students who will be our future.</p>
